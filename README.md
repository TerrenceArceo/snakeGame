# snakeGame
Just a simple OG snake game from the early 2000s

## Overview
This game was the very first project I built from Scrimba Front-end Career Path as I progress through the course.

## How to play?
- Control the snake using your right, left, up, and down arrow keys.
- The speed and length of the snake Increases as your score increases by eating "Apples"
- The game is over once the snake collided with itself or any of the four walls

## How to make this game more interesting?
- make the snake go through walls and appear to the opposite side of the grid
- add another food that give more score, other than just eating apples
